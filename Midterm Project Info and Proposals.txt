	Security

		wide variety of password policies such as minimum length, complexity, or expiration. 
	*(Granular User Access Control)
		-it can give administrators complete control over who can see and who can modify every part of a site. Drupal operates 			based on a system of extensible user roles and access permissions. Administrators can create user roles and give them 	
		specific, limited permissions.
	Highly Scalable
		-it won’t matter if your site gets hit with lots of traffic and goes down.
	Easy Content Authoring
		-Intuitive tools in Drupal for content creation, workflow and publishing make it easy for content creators to do their
		jobs. Authentication and permissions help manage editorial workflows efficiently, and previews show how content will
		look on any device before users approve and publish.
	Content Revisioning
		-enables a quick and easy way to track all changes and revisions and it also track the history of content changes.
	Content Tagging and Taxonomy
		- Drupal’s strength is creating structured content – define content elements, tag content based on any attributes, 			create relevant taxonomy for content so it can be searched, found, used, and reused in ways that satisfy visitors.
